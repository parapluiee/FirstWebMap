# My Greenway Run Route

This is my first web map made from scratch (sort-of). I decided to keep things simple and highlight one of my favorite running spots in Boone, the [greenway](https://www.exploreboone.com/outdoors/hiking/boone-greenway/). It is a very known and well-liked spot among many. I really like the area because it's one of the only areas immediately within Boone that is not 100% developed. And I find it funny that it is only like this because the land on the greenway is not stable for development. Nonetheless, it is a place I hold close to my heart.  

## Major functions

Major map functions include a line string that highlights my personal favorite route to take when running the greenway.

Two points of interest include the start/end point and the turnaround point. Three other data points make note of some locations I find interesting. Two of which are major bridges along the route that are good spots to look for fish. The final point is a small overlook that takes a little bit of hiking to get to. You can see which point is which by hovering your mouse over the respective point.
